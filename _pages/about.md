<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently in the second year of my MPhil degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My supervisors are <a href="https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/faculty/jidongxu">Prof. Dongxu Ji</a> and <a href="https://harrybinary.github.io/">Dr. Shuaibin Wan</a>. I completed my bachelor's degree at the Harbin Institute of Technology and participated in a one-year joint training program at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the same time, I am also a contracted writer for Zhihu Columns and Jinjiang Literature Website.

My research interests include text generation and multi-scale agent systems. I will periodically update my dynamics here and share my experience in transferring major. I welcome any form of collaboration. Please feel free to contact my email: 223015122@link.cuhk.edu.cn. I will reply within 3 working days.
